### Exploring the Journey of Asian Women in STEM at ISU

Welcome to "Exploring the Journey of Asian Women in STEM at ISU," a project dedicated to uncovering the narratives, challenges, and triumphs of Asian women faculty members in STEM fields at Iowa State University (ISU). This project was conducted in two phases, with the first phase taking place during the Summer of 2023.

In the first phase, I conducted oral history interviews with 6 Asian women faculty members at ISU, representing various STEM disciplines. These interviews aimed to reveal their unique experiences in academia.

To make these interviews accessible, a WordPress website was developed to showcase the interviews and related content. In the second phase, I created a multimedia website integrating the Oral History as a Data (OHD) tool, enhancing the viewing experience by enabling the analysis and publication of coded oral history or qualitative interview files.

### About Oral History as Data

Oral History as Data was first built in 2018, coming out of work at the University of Idaho Library's [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (CD?L)](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/). 
The framework served as the foundation for several digital humanities projects, including [Voices of Gay Rodeo](https://www.voicesofgayrodeo.com/), [Idaho Queered](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/queered/), and [CTRL+Shift](https://ctrl-shift.org/).
