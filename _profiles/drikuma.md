### ***From Microbiology to Environmental Engineering: Dr. Kaoru Ikuma’s Journey in Academia and Advocacy for Diversity of Thoughts***

Meet Dr. Kaoru Ikuma, an accomplished Associate Professor and Cerwick Faculty Fellow at Iowa State University. Her research endeavors center around environmental microbiology and biotechnology, with a particular focus on biodegradation of hazardous contaminants and sustainable water and wastewater treatment. Beyond her scientific pursuits, Kaoru is a strong advocate for water security and environmental justice, seeking to make a positive impact in the realm of environmental biofilm microbiology.

Driven by a thirst for knowledge and a desire to make a meaningful impact, Dr. Ikuma pursued research fervently during her master's and doctoral studies. Her dedication and expertise flourished, propelling her to seek new opportunities and broaden her horizons through postdoctoral positions. In 2015, she found her academic home at Iowa State University, where she later achieved the significant milestone of tenure in 2022.

Throughout her journey, Dr. Ikuma's experiences and observations have shaped her perspective profoundly. A pivotal moment came when she discovered the profound impact of environmental engineering on everyday life. From providing clean water to supporting human health and wellbeing, she recognized the silent yet essential role of her field in society's functioning.

This realization was further underscored by a personal experience with the aftermath of a powerful earthquake in Japan, which left her without running water for two months. The hardship she endured during this time cemented her commitment to being part of the force that safeguards society from such crises, strengthening her resolve to contribute meaningfully through her work.

“I wanted to be one of the people who are in the behind-the-scenes supporting society.”

DR. IKUMA

As an Asian woman in the male-dominated STEM field, Dr. Ikuma brings a unique perspective and voice to her work. She believes that diversity of thought is a powerful asset, one that is especially crucial in fields like environmental engineering, where connections to society and human health are profound. Dr. Ikuma advocates passionately for the amplification of women's voices and the consideration of diverse perspectives, recognizing their vital role in driving innovation and progress.

Her advocacy extends beyond mere words; Dr. Ikuma actively promotes the creation of inclusive environments in academia and beyond. She emphasizes the importance of concerted efforts from all stakeholders to ensure that diverse voices are valued, heard, and respected. For Dr. Ikuma, fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion is not just a goal but a necessity for driving meaningful change and advancing society as a whole.

In sharing her story and insights, Dr. Ikuma inspires us to embrace diversity and inclusivity in all facets of life. Her journey serves as a beacon of hope and empowerment for aspiring academics, demonstrating the transformative power of embracing diverse perspectives and voices in the pursuit of knowledge and progress.
