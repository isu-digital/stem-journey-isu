### ***Seizing Opportunities: Dr. Lu Liu’s Inspiring Journey in STEM***



Dr. Lu Liu, a leading researcher in civil engineering and environmental science, shared her inspiring journey in STEM during our interview. Originally from China, she earned her bachelor's and master's degrees in environmental science at the University of Oklahoma before completing her Ph.D. in civil engineering in 2017. Driven by a passion for sustainable engineering, she joined Iowa State University as a faculty member in 2021.

*“Engineering, especially civil engineering, is a very traditional type of study. They haven’t seen many faces like this, so they’re kind of skeptical.”*

DR. LU LIU


Throughout our conversation, Dr. Liu discussed her research focus on water resources, stemming from concerns about environmental issues in China. She highlighted the challenges she faced as a young Asian female faculty member, including student perceptions influenced by her identity. Despite these obstacles, Dr. Liu remains hopeful for a more inclusive learning environment in the future.

She also shared insights from her professional journey, including experiences in industry and nonprofit organizations. Although her time in the oil and gas industry didn't align with her passion, her nonprofit work provided valuable skills in grantsmanship and networking. Dr. Liu emphasized the importance of increasing female faculty representation in STEM to positively impact female student recruitment.

Dr. Liu's recent achievement includes co-writing a news article about flooding in the U.S., which garnered widespread readership and led to an invitation to speak at the [Indiana Water Summit](https://thewhiteriveralliance.org/programs/water-summit/2023-speakers/). She encourages junior faculty, especially Asian females, to embrace opportunities and showcase their expertise. Driven by a desire to challenge skepticism, Dr. Liu's journey exemplifies the potential rewards of being open to new opportunities in STEM.
