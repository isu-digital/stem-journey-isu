Professor Li's journey in academia serves as a testament to resilience and determination, illuminating the challenges and triumphs faced by women in STEM fields. After completing her doctorate, she navigated through various academic roles, including a visiting assistant professorship at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Department of Statistics, before finding her home at Iowa State University's Industrial Engineering Department in 2018.

Reflecting on her undergraduate years, Professor Li candidly shared the hurdles she encountered as a female student in a predominantly male field. Initially the only woman in her cohort, she grappled with isolation and struggled with hands-on experiments. However, through perseverance and resourcefulness, she found solidarity among fellow female students and formed study groups to enhance her learning experience. Her journey underscores the importance of seeking support and camaraderie in overcoming obstacles and achieving success in academia.

Professor Li also sheds light on the gender representation challenges in engineering, particularly the declining ratio of female students as one progresses to higher education and faculty positions. She attributes this trend to a variety of factors, including differences in interests and family responsibilities. Drawing from her personal experience of balancing career aspirations with family obligations, she emphasizes the realities that impact the representation of women in STEM fields.

In her current research pursuits, Professor Li focuses on quality-related studies in advanced manufacturing and healthcare data analytics. Through her work, she aims to improve manufacturing processes, product quality, and healthcare outcomes, demonstrating her commitment to making tangible contributions to society.

For aspiring Asian women in STEM, Professor Li offers valuable advice: "Do not give up." Drawing from her own journey, she highlights the importance of perseverance, even in the face of adversity. Despite encountering doubts and difficulties along the way, the support from friends, family, and mentors served as pillars of strength, propelling her forward. Professor Li's story serves as an inspiring example of the transformative power of determination and resilience in achieving one's goals, making her a beacon of hope for aspiring women in STEM.

In conclusion, Professor Li’s journey in STEM is a testament to the power of determination and the importance of mentorship in overcoming challenges. As a female academic in traditionally male-dominated fields, she has faced isolation and gender differences, but her unwavering perseverance and support from mentors have propelled her forward.
