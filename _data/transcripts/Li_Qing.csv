[00:00:00],Mansi," Um, hello and thank you again for joining",
[00:00:02],Professor Li," me here. Yes,",
[00:00:02],Mansi,"Um, I want, um, just to begin with, if you can tell us about your background and, uh, how did you end",
[00:00:10],Professor Li," up in this field? Sure, sure. Uh, for background, do you mean educational background? Yes. Okay. Sure, sure. Um, I did my undergraduate studies in electrical engineering, um, back in China.",Education
[00:00:24],Professor Li," Um, then I went to University of Rochester, uh, for my master's degree, also in electrical engineering. And, uh, after I graduated I switched to stats PhD, uh, in Virginia Tech. And, uh, after that I. I worked as a visiting assistant professor, uh, in the Department of the state from University of Wisconsin Medicine.",Education
[00:00:49],Professor Li," And finally I came to I S U yeah. To work, um, in the industrial engineering department. Mm-hmm.",Education
[00:00:56],Mansi," Okay. Uh, and you have been at I S U from, um, how many years now?",
[00:01:01],Professor Li," Uh, 2018. So since 2018 now. Uh, five years. Okay.",
[00:01:06],Mansi," Yeah. Yeah, that sounds good. Um, so in terms of you being, so you are currently in the Department of Industrial Engineering, you said, right?",
[00:01:15],Mansi," Yeah. So what kind of motivated you to be in this field, or even like choosing your bachelor's degree, what made you think, what was the motivation behind it? Hmm.",
[00:01:29],Professor Li," Yeah, it's mainly, uh, back in China, well, um, I would see like, like my parents, uh, consulted, uh, several people. And this thing, uh, electrical engineering is very promising.",Motivations
[00:01:43],Professor Li, Good to find a job. Okay. Yeah. It's mainly from that aspect. So I choose electrical engineering.,Motivations
[00:01:52],Mansi," Okay. Okay. No. Yeah, that's probably a lot of us who end up in a field, which is like, okay, my parents,",
[00:01:59],Professor Li," uh, and everyone around, like, it's,",
[00:02:01],Mansi," um, sometimes that is the motivation. So yeah. Thank you",
[00:02:05],Professor Li," for sharing. Oh, no problem.",
[00:02:08],Mansi," Um, so while you were in the field in terms of like when you did your bachelor's, master's mm-hmm. PhD. Were there any specific challenges because you belong to Asia or you belong to female? Because sometimes a lot of fields are dominated by, uh, males. So were there any specific challenges which you faced?",
[00:03:33],Professor Li,"I feel it's really difficult for me to do those experiments. I mean, um, though I prepared very hard still. Yeah, it takes me, I mean, I just didn't",Challenges
[00:03:44],Professor Li," it or it, it's very hard for me. I did, uh, notice the difference between gender. Um, of course there are some, you know, there are are some. Female students still, they're very good.",Challenges
[00:03:58],Professor Li," Right? Um, but that's my observation. I think, uh, on the average there are some of the things, um, like the female, I mean, male students are better. Uh, doing those and at the same time, yeah, there are some of the fields that, I guess like language, right? Some of the things, yeah. Uh, the female students I think are better, uh, on the average.",Challenges
[00:04:23],Professor Li," Okay. Yes. Okay. I think, yeah, yeah, yeah. Indeed. Uh, I remember those years. I think, uh, it was challenging. Yeah. I feel frustrated, um, because I didn't. Uh, I feel like I didn't understand those. Um, yeah.",Challenges
[00:04:41],Mansi," Well, uh, so in terms of, uh, having challenges, how did you kind of overcome that? Because you started with like, just being the first or like the only female in the cohort.",
[00:04:52],Mansi, So how did you manage everything with your studies and making sure that you do your masters and then PhD even though you had a kind of a rough start.,
[00:05:00],Professor Li," Yeah. Uh, for my first, yeah, my first semester, the cohort, I mean, I was in a, on the cohort that I was the only female student, but later, uh, I kind of changed the, A cohort.",Challenges; Women in STEM
[00:05:13],Professor Li," Yeah, I changed the cohort. Okay. Yeah. Went to like in general, uh, to the department classes. Then like, uh, there are, I mean, in that cohort there are six out of 30. Uh, female students actually. So it, it, it becomes much better. Yeah. So now I, I like my roommates. Usually we try to discuss, we try to select the same classes so that like we ca",Challenges; Women in STEM
[00:05:40],Professor Li," And discuss and, uh, um, do the homework together, et cetera. It makes things much easier. Yeah. Yeah. Totally. Yeah.",Challenges; Women in STEM
[00:05:50],Mansi," Absolutely. So in terms of, um, mm-hmm. So that brings me to, and thi uh, makes me think about, uh, representation in class. So when you teach your classes right now mm-hmm. Or when you have like your faculty meetings, do you think that you have.",
[00:06:06],Mansi," Enough representation of yourself out there, or, um, do you think it should be improved? In terms of like how we have students out? Mm-hmm. In our, especially industrial engineering. I don't remember any friend from industrial engineering so far.",
[00:06:22],Professor Li," Oh, okay. Indeed. Yeah. I think, um, for undergraduate students, maybe in general, there are 30% Mm.",ISU Diversity
[00:06:31],Professor Li," Okay. Of female students, I think in general. And, uh, when you go to like, uh, graduate studies and then, uh, professional career, I think the, uh, the ratio is decreasing actually. Okay. So undergraduate, actually the ratio of female, it's actually the biggest. That's my impression. And then as you, uh, To move higher in education, et cetera?",ISU Diversity
[00:06:58],Professor Li," Uh, female? Yeah. In general, I think it's di decreasing. For example, for, I think for tenure track, uh, faculty. Now in I s u, uh, female in engineering is roughly 25%, um, 20 or 25%. I cannot remember. But you can see, uh, it's relatively, uh, small compared with male. Um, I think that's fair. It's. Because of the Like one thing is the gender dif",ISU Diversity
[00:07:28],Professor Li," Yeah, yeah, yeah. Being like Right. Interest, et cetera. Maybe for me, I see that like I'm more interested in certain things, right? Compare, like for example, my husband is very interested hands on like those electronics, right? I feel like. In general, um, the interest, uh, there's a difference. And then there is also family situations, right?",ISU Diversity
[00:07:54],Professor Li," Yeah. I think, uh, the, the biggest challenge for female is, is especially when they go to their career, they're at the age of like having children, taking care of their family, et cetera. Uh, I think that's very challenging for most of the, uh, females, right? Um, like I, I still remember the time like. Well, for example, childbirth.",ISU Diversity
[00:08:17],Professor Li," I think it's, it's, uh, I mean it's very challenging for female deaf and I feel like I, it almost took me three years to fully recover. Yes. From the childbirth, you know, like your, uh, energy, uh, yeah. Those type of things. And, uh, I think more naturally moms tend to take care of their babies. Right. More carefully, like et cetera, tend to spend",ISU Diversity
[00:08:47],Professor Li," I think, yeah, these are all the, uh, realities, um, that affect the, I I would see the ratio of. A female, uh, female in like professional, I mean, engineering field is especially STEM field.",ISU Diversity
[00:09:01],Mansi," Yeah, absolutely. No, um, that's, that totally makes sense because that is what the reality is. Um, so far, uh, we have seen around.",
[00:09:09],Mansi," Um, well, uh, thank you so much for sharing all like your website. experience. Oh, no problem. Just changing the gears a little bit, uh, we will, I would definitely, uh, would love to know more about what you are currently, maybe if you're working on any research mm-hmm. Or if, if you wanna share any memorable accomplishment, um, which you would like us to share on",
[00:09:30],Professor Li," Mm-hmm. Um, uh, well, I would say, um, well I would definitely, uh, see like female. I mean this underrepresented, uh, underrepresented like faculties are a blessing to the students. I can imagine. Yeah. Um, like if the students see no female professors right. In engineering department, I, yeah, I, I can see that indeed affect people's, uh, choices opinions when they, uh, make their decisions.",Representation
[00:10:06],Professor Li," Uh, I definitely think that's valuable. Uh, at the same time, I feel like now, It's getting better and better, right? I read about, uh, like previously, women are not, not allowed to attend for marathon. Not allowed, you know, a lot of things, but now I think it's getting better and better. Um, can compete a lot of times fairly with, uh, yeah, other",Representation
[00:10:33],Professor Li," So I think it's getting better, uh, considering contributions. Uh, I, so now I'm doing, uh, statistical quality assurance. And the healthcare data analytics, machine learning related, uh, methodology and applications. Mm-hmm. Um, for, yeah, there are a lot of people doing this for, um, for contributions, I would see like, um, how can I say that?",Representation
[00:11:01],Professor Li," Uh, I would say, yeah, we, we, we do our work, right? Try to treat, uh, our job. Seriously, um, do as best as we can, uh, advise students, et cetera. Yeah. Like I, I think like any other professors are doing.",Representation
[00:11:18],Mansi," Absolutely. Um, yeah, I was more into, uh, asking about more about your particular, if you are doing any research work right now mm-hmm.",
[00:11:27],Mansi," Which you would like to share, elaborate, um, just. People who are watching, uh, who would be watching it or reading about, um, the interview if they are into that kind of research. Um, oh yeah, yeah. Definitely Share more about your",
[00:11:42],Professor Li," research. Sure, sure. Um, so now my research is mainly in like, uh, quality related, uh, research.",Accomplishment
[00:11:51],Professor Li," Like, like on the data side, like for example, in advance the manufacturing. Mm-hmm. Uh, especially in like, for example, three D printing, uh, the quality. The effectiveness, right? Of the manufacturing process and the products. These are very important, especially in sectors like, um, uh, like when you are ma making air aircraft, et cetera, right?",Accomplishment
[00:12:14],Professor Li," For those NASA projects, the. Uh, products are very important. So, uh, one area of my research is in like trying to evaluating, monitoring the processes, inspecting the, uh, quality of the products and how we can, uh, improve the, uh, manufacturing and, uh, inspection, um, processes. This is one area. Another area is in, uh, health, healthcare, data",Accomplishment
[00:12:46],Professor Li," And, uh, so nowadays, like when you go to hospital, actually you, you can see they collect a lot of data, your demographics data and, uh, when they do, for example, lab test results and when you, uh, need to stay in the hospital, they also, yeah, collect all this like vital sign data, et cetera. Um, so how can we, uh, use, utilize all this data to,",Accomplishment
[00:13:15],Professor Li," Healthcare practitioners to make decisions, allocate resources, et cetera. So that's mainly the second, um, area of my focus. Mm-hmm.",Accomplishment
[00:13:25],Mansi," Okay. Yeah. So you talked, uh, earlier you talked that your main area of focus or your interest is in statistics, and then right now you're talking about use of data in different Yeah.",
[00:13:37],Mansi, Yes. Right. So,
[00:13:38],Professor Li," yeah, I would say it becomes more and more, uh, I mean, Because I realize, oh, how useful data can be. Um, so, so from, for now, I think it's really, um, pro motivated by real problems. So it depends on, okay, what are the problems? And uh, so then we try to develop and identify methods to solve these problems.",Research
[00:14:03],Professor Li," Um, so it depends on the problem rate. Sometimes we may need to use statistical modeling. Sometimes maybe we need to, uh, combine like statistics and, uh, tradi, I mean machine learning or deep planning. So it really depends on the problem. Um, it's, especially now you can see like the boundaries. Um, I mean there are a lot of interdisciplinary rese",Research
[00:14:29],Professor Li," I, I think most of the complex problems now cannot be solved by people from one field. Right. It has to be a, um, integration. I mean, it has to be, uh, uh, let's see, efforts from different expertise. That's just the how things work now, I think. Yeah, absolutely.",Research
[00:14:51],Mansi," Yeah. So, uh, and this is just, uh, based on your, um, Kind of experience and what you do right now in terms of, and me being curious student from data and information systems, what kind of, um, applications do, uh, do you use?",
[00:15:10],Mansi," Um, if you want to, uh, glance it over",
[00:15:13],Professor Li," that? Well, by applications do you mean what kind of fields this research can be used? So the",
[00:15:21],Mansi," application, so for example, for data, I think we use R",
[00:15:26],Professor Li," Oh, you mean software? Yeah, software. I'm so sorry. Oh, oh, I see, I see. I think in academia, uh, like especially instead, people like to use r.",
[00:15:36],Professor Li," Um, but I think, uh, now more and more people use Python. Mm. Because it's very powerful in, uh, doing deep learning, machine learning type of things. And in industry, I think a lot of people use Python and some people may also use Met Lab. Um, okay. Yes. I think this are the main software, uh, people used.",
[00:15:59],Mansi, Okay.,
[00:15:59],Mansi," Thank you. Um, okay, so moving on to a kind of a different, uh, topic. So this is more about what do you think, um, mentorship and networking has played a role in your career so far? Mm-hmm. So how important was mentorship and networking for you so far?",

[00:16:24],Professor Li," Um, I, I just remember for example, my advisor. He is very, uh, encouraging and very supportive. And I, uh, and also another professor when I was a graduate student, like she was so encouraging. Yeah, I remember, um, like one of my paper was rejected, uh, five times. I. Um, yeah, it's, it's very frustrating. Um, like sometimes without that encourage",Technology
[00:16:56],Professor Li," Yeah. But it, yeah, encouraging you, um, give you advice, et cetera. So I feel, oh, it's not that bad. Maybe, uh, I can move on. Yeah.

[00:17:25],Professor Li," Yeah. Yeah. I, I would say mentorship definitely is crucial. Okay.",Technology
[00:17:30],Mansi," Uh, and then, um, How did you manage, uh, making sure that you have a good network with your colleagues or outside world while you, because I feel like when graduate students go into research work or academia, it gets very overloaded with like your research work.",
[00:17:48],Mansi," So how did you make, uh, those, those transitions?",
[00:17:52],Professor Li," Hmm. Yes. I would say in general, like I'm a people person, so I like to be with people. Um, I like to communicate with people. I, I guess that's for personality. Like I can understand just working on my own. Okay. So I need to talk with people like maybe so, and also because of the, uh, nature of my field, like statistics.",Network
[00:18:15],Professor Li," Right. You have to, uh, You have to collaborate with people from other fields to come up with problems to solve and, uh, how to, uh, uh, interpret it. Right?
